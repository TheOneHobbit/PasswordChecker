# PasswordChecker
This is a mini-project using C#, logic and conditional statements to create a Password Checker program, which feeds back to the user whether their password creation meets requiremments or not. To date, the output was tested in a Bash terminal and ran with "dotnet run".
This project was taken from the Codecademy site and completed as an off-platform project i.e. using my own environment, namely Visual Studio Code.
